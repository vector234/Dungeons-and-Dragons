# Dungeons-and-Dragons

The code included is designed to contain a Dungeons and Dragons character sheet hard coded to contain the relevant features and statistics, with the capacity to select each feature and make generate a random roll much like rolling a physical dice. The physical unit is an Arduino Mega with an LCD keypad shield, leaving 6 buttons and a 2x16 character display available for use without any further expansions.

Currently implemented is a string display showing HP and various AC (being from 3.5e this means all three forms of AC) as well as 0th and 1st level spells.
